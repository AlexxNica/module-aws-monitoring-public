# ELB Access Logs

The module `elb-access-logs` has  been replaced with the [load-balancer-access-logs module](../load-balancer-access-logs) 
and works with both the [Classic Load Balancer](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/introduction.html) 
and [Application Load Balancer](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html).
